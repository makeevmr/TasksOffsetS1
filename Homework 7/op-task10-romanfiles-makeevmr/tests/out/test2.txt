Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. 
Numbers are written with combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet, each letter with a fixed integer value, modern style uses only these seven: I V X L C D M 
The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced by Arabic numerals; however, this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persists in some applications to this day.

One place they are often seen is on clock faces. For instance, on the clock of Big Ben (designed in MDCCCLII), the hours from I to XII are written as: I , II , III , IV , V , VI , VII , VIII , IX , X , XI , XII

The notations IV and IX can be read as "one less than five" and "one less than ten", although there is a tradition favouring representation of "4" as "IIII" on Roman numeral clocks.

Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the title screens of movies and television programs. 
MCM signifying "a thousand, and a hundred less than another thousand", so MCMXII is written MCMXII. For the years of this century, MM indicates 2000. The current year is MMXXII (MMXXII).

A number containing two or more decimal digits is built by appending the Roman numeral equivalent for each, from highest to lowest, as in the following examples:
  XXXIX = XXX + IX = XXXIX.
 CCXLVI = CC + XL + VI = CCXLVI.
 DCCLXXXIX = DCC + LXXX + IX = DCCLXXXIX.
MMCDXXI = MM + CD + XX + I = MMCDXXI.

Any missing place (represented by a zero in the place-value equivalent) is omitted, as in Latin (and English) speech:
 CLX = C + LX = CLX
 CCVII = CC + VII = CCVII
MIX = M + IX = MIX
MLXVI = M + LX + VI = MLXVI

In practice, Roman numerals for numbers over M are currently used mainly for year numbers, as in these examples:
MDCCLXXVI = M + DCC + LXX + VI = MDCCLXXVI (the date written on the book held by the Statue of Liberty).
MCMXVIII = M + CM + X + VIII = MCMXVIII (the first year of the Spanish flu pandemic)
MCMLIV = M + CM + L + IV = MCMLIV (as in the trailer for the movie The Last Time I Saw Paris)
MMXIV = MM + X + IV = MMXIV (the year of the games of the XXII (22nd) Olympic Winter Games (in Sochi, Russia))
